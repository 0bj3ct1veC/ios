# FetLife for iOS

Welcome to the official FetLife iOS open-source client! :confetti_ball: We're excited to start developing our iOS app as an open-source project and allowing the community to engage and contribute.

## Getting started

The app is still a major work in progress. The goal is to take the base FetLife chat application and add more features and API endpoints to match the other features on fetlife.com.

The current operating system target of the application is iOS 9.0 or higher.

If you find a bug or want to contribute, please start by reading through the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/fetlife/fetlife-ios/issues) and [contributing](https://github.com/fetlife/fetlife-ios/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines.
