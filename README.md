These instructions are written assuming you know very little about computers and to help get the app on your iPhone as quickly as possible:

1. Install the latest version of [Xxode](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).
2. Open the `Terminal` application up on your Mac.
3. Enter the following commands into your terminal window one by one and wait for them to finish:
  - `sudo gem install cocoapods` you will be prompted for your computers password
  - `git clone git@github.com:fetlife/fetlife-ios.git`
  - `cd fetlife-ios`
  - `pod install`
  - `open FetLife.xcworkspace`
4. Installing the app on your phone:
  - Connect your iPhone to your computer.
  - Select your iPhone from the "[Scheme toolbar menu](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/Art/5_launchappondevice_2x.png)".
  - Click the "Run" button.
5. Follow the instructions in the pop up windows i.e.:
  - Click "Fix Issue".
  - Enter in the username and password for your iCloud account.
